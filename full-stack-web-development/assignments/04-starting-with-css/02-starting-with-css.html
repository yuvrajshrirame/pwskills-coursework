    <h1>CSS - Information</h1>
    <p>
        CSS refers to Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. CSS adds
        beauty to the webpage and make the webpage look more visually appealing. CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of
        English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content
        and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
