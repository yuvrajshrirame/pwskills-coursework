        or leverage existing skills with new, future-driven upgrades that will help them realise their full potential. <br><br>
        PW Skills' mission is to permeate through every student/professional's outlook towards jobs and change their attitude
        and perspective from “How Can I Do It?” to “Of Course I Can Do It”. We aim to do this by providing exceptional
        upskilling courses at affordable rates, while being tech-forward so anyone, anywhere can access and improve their
        ability to be successful in life. <br><br>
        PW Skills, the skilling vertical of Physics Wallah launched late last year, has outlined a plan to invest Rs 120 crore
        in the next two-three years to provide upskilling courses at competitive prices. "We want to address the issue of
        inaccessibility and steep pricing of most tech and upskilling courses, as well as the lack of practical training and
        teaching of basics. Additionally, there is a significant gap in training availability in vernacular languages. PW Skills
        is committed to bridging these gaps by investing Rs 120 crore in the next 2-3 years to provide quality content, taught
        from the basics by industry professionals, at competitive prices," said Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PW, in a
        statement. <br><br>
