<!-- Question-02: You have been assigned a task to implement a theme toggle
feature for a website. The website currently displays which mode
it is in (either "Dark Mode" or "Light Mode") and has a toggle
button. The challenge is to use DOM manipulation to toggle the
theme between dark and light modes when the button is clicked.
